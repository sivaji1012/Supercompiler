ApproxMOSES — approximate evolutionary program learning with p-box fitness.

Implements §5 of the Approximate Supercompilation spec (Goertzel, Oct 2025):
  §5.1  EvolutionaryPBox struct (individual_id, fitness_pbox, rank_pbox,
        heritability, evaluation_count)
  §5.2  Algorithm 5 — ApproximateFitness (already in EvoSpecializer.jl, extended here)
  §5.3  Algorithm 6 — TournamentWithPBox (Monte Carlo tournament selection)
  §5.4  Heritability crossover formula from quantitative genetics
  §5.5  Algorithm 7 — AllocateEvaluations (value of information, in EvoSpecializer.jl)
  §5.6  Convergence detection: overlap(Fᵢ, Fⱼ) > 0.5 threshold

Note: EvolutionaryPBox struct and Algorithms 5+7 exist in EvoSpecializer.jl.
This file adds the missing pieces: Algorithm 6 (TournamentWithPBox) + §5.4
heritability + §5.6 convergence. No duplication — each file owns its algorithms.

                         size::Int) -> EvolutionaryPBox

Algorithm 6 (TournamentWithPBox) from §5.3.

Monte Carlo tournament selection with overlapping p-boxes.

For each candidate cᵢ in the tournament:
  1. Draw MONTE_CARLO_TRIALS samples of (fᵢ, f_others)
  2. Count how many times fᵢ > max(f_others)
  3. win_probability[i] = count / MONTE_CARLO_TRIALS

Why Monte Carlo? "With overlapping p-boxes, analytical formulas become intractable.
MC gives good estimates with bounded computation." — spec §5.3.
